description: "<p>Excited and eager to learn more about the IT Industry, the move to Christchurch and the assignment as the Business Systems Administrator of the Government Enterprise Management Suite (GEMS) applications was a true honour.
                            <p>With 450 daily active users and being a member of a small team meant that in the beginning with my days were managing database, windows and application administration tasks.</p>
                            <p>Over time a picked up PERL and used this as the tool to automate a large majority of these manual tasks, such as creating a web socket load balancer to spread users across varying application servers or auto mating database loads from SAP. This role taught me that if you haven't automated your original job within two years, that you're not working hard enough.</p>
