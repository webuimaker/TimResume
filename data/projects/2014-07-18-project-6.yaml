description: "<p>Formed in 2001, WML Software provides professional services focused on custom software and web solutions for Mitre 10 New Zealand. As the service desk managed I was the voice of the organsiation to the staff from their 125 stores nation wide.
                            <p>Providing first level support to start with, over time I grew to see the patterns and common pain points of our clients. With little or no experience of the Linux platform I sat down and studied hard to understand a way that I could prevent the customers from having to call.</p>
                            <p>What I did during my time at WML is something that I have carried throughout all my jobs. That if you can't automate your role in 2 years then your not working hard enough. And this is exactly what I did working for WML. When I started it was common to see between 50-60 tickets per week, Through what I like to think is a well rounded Software Development Life Cycle, was in fact achieve through proactive front line intervention.</p>

                            <h3>ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Through automation and proactive front line initiatives, we saw a over all reduction in support calls from 60 per week, to ~20 per month</li>
                                    <li>I caught the Linux Bug. It gave me the tools that I have become so found of and now reliant on for the last 10 years.</li>
